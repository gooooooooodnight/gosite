<li>This year is my nineteenth year exploring the world, and I am very grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity to see this world. Perhaps my definition of this world is not perfect, but I believe that I see the beautiful side of it. It was when I was fourteen years old that I saw the glass window of Notre Dame Cathedral before it was burned down, when I slowly sat on a Venetian cruise ship in the light rain, and when I saw the hem of my skirt blown up by the free wind countless times It was the first crappy Chinese meal made for us by the host family&rsquo;s grandmother in Canada during our sophomore year of junior high school. It was me who bounced down the stairs every morning with the sound of &ldquo;girls, breakfast&rdquo; I have seen the rising sun and the scavenger resting by the trash can at night….</li>
<li>So, Dear player, congratulations on successfully passing the 19th level. Please continue to explore the main storyline, unlock more storylines, and trigger special Easter eggs!!!!</li>
