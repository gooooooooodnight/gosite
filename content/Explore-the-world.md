-   This year is my nineteenth year exploring the world, and I am very grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity to see this world. Perhaps my definition of this world is not perfect, but I believe that I see the beautiful side of it. It was when I was fourteen years old that I saw the glass window of Notre Dame Cathedral before it was burned down, when I slowly sat on a Venetian cruise ship in the light rain, and when I saw the hem of my skirt blown up by the free wind countless times It was the first crappy Chinese meal made for us by the host family's grandmother in Canada during our sophomore year of junior high school. It was me who bounced down the stairs every morning with the sound of "girls, breakfast" I have seen the rising sun and the scavenger resting by the trash can at nightâ€¦.
-   So, Dear player, congratulations on successfully passing the 19th level. Please continue to explore the main storyline, unlock more storylines, and trigger special Easter eggs!!!!
