-  The Macao I introduced to you must not be objective, because it was my countless escapes back to the dormitory with tired body. It was a 25B that could never be crowded, a clothes that could never be dried, a tasteless meal, a sweet Stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs, a cold and crazy typhoon, a never better eczema on my body, a fiery early sun on the Black Sand Beach in the morning, a pink and purple sky outside the school, and a strange weather without autumn.
-  So, this is not Macau.
-  This is my 19th year old. Just like I was drenched in rain in Macau, so I would like to introduce to you that Macau is a rainy city with a long and deep rainy season.
